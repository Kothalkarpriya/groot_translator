            Groot is a fictional character appearing in AMerican comics and in marval movies. Perticularly in Guardians of the Galaxy.

        <p>
            Groot played a part in Annihilation: Conquest, at which time it was shown Groot may be the last remaining member of the Flora colossi, and was under arrest by the Kree for an unknown reason. Groot earned freedom by joining Star-Lord's strike force, where Groot and Rocket Raccoon formed a bond, Rocket being one of the few beings with the ability to understand Groot's language.

            Groot is an extraterrestrial tree monster who initially came to Earth seeking humans to capture and study. Groot was seemingly destroyed by termites used by Leslie Evans. Xemnu made a duplicate of Groot by making a human and tree hybrid that was used to fight the Hulk, but it was destroyed in the battle.

            Groot can absorb wood as food, and has the ability to regenerate. Groot can control trees and plants, using them to attack others, and appears to be resistant to fire. Groot is able to sprout dramatically increasing mass which then severely inhibits movement. Groot has been seemingly killed on multiple occasions, each time regrowing from a sprig.
